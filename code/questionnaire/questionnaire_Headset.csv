One meeting I was sitting down and the floor planar detection recognized me as sitting on the floor because I was sitting on a futon couch on the floor. I was embarrassed other students were sitting on traditional chairs and were shown to be 'standing' in the presentation (some may actually be standing). So I wouldn't stick out as sitting on the floor for our guest presentations I changed my avatar to a cat because it was naturally already 'on the floor'. One benefit of VR is it 'levels' the playing field so to speak and portrays each individual in a decontextualized manner, so users focus more on the content of what the person is saying rather than other nonverbal signals. If someone was wheelchair bound or bedridden the traditional Mozzilla hubs avatar would 'out' them as not being able bodied. Some users may not want to reveal this to others. This is not a security concern or a major privacy concern to most users but I can see how what could be potentially a big reason for a particular group to adopt the technology not being fully realized with the current default hubs avatar.",The biggest difference for me was it felt like it was easier to see who was paying attention to the lecture during the Hubs meetings because I could see where peoples faces were directed. I feel like some people turn on their screen and then 'zone out' and either don't pay attention or pay minimal attention and do something else. With the oculus device it was almost impossible to do anything else other than pay attention unless one took the device off. I thought it was interesting to see where people were facing. The best part of zoom is you can see peoples facial expressions. This helps a lot to get a feeling of the tone of a situation and what another persons intentions are. ,33
